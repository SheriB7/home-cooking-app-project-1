<h1>Everything but the Kitchen Sink</h1>
<p>Our goal with this project is to create an application where users can find recipes using the ingredients they have in their kitchen.<p>
Users will be able to specify what meal they are cooking and their skill level, and then select ingredients that they would like to use in a recipe.
